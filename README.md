# DevOps Lifecycle

## Foundational DevOps Concepts

**DevOps** is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. 

**The core principles of DevOps include** collaboration, automation, continuous integration and delivery, monitoring, and feedback. By fostering a culture of shared responsibility and transparency, DevOps aims to break down silos between development and operations teams, enabling faster and more reliable software releases.

## DevOps Lifecycle Stages

- **Planning:** Teams define project requirements, set goals, and outline the roadmap for development, ensuring alignment with business objectives.
- **Development:** Code is written, reviewed, and managed using version control systems, focusing on collaboration and code quality.
- **Building:** Source code is compiled and built into deployable artifacts, often using automated build tools to ensure consistency.
- **Testing:** Automated and manual tests are executed to validate functionality, performance, and security, identifying defects early in the process.
- **Release:** Approved builds are prepared for deployment, with release management ensuring that only stable versions move forward.
- **Deployment:** Applications are deployed to production or staging environments, often using automated deployment pipelines for speed and reliability.
- **Operations:** The deployed application is managed and maintained, with teams handling infrastructure, scaling, and incident response.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of application performance and user experience provides feedback, enabling proactive issue resolution and ongoing improvement.

By following these stages, organizations can achieve faster delivery cycles, improved product quality, and greater alignment between development and operations teams.
